"""
This script filters out overlapping sentenceâ€“gloss pairs from the training data
to prevent data leakage into evaluation. It:
  - Loads test and dev CSV files and collects all (full_sentence, glosses) pairs.
  - Reads the training CSV(s) and removes any rows that exactly match a test/dev pair.
  - Saves the cleaned training data to new CSV files prefixed with 'filtered_'.
Use this to ensure that evaluation sets remain unseen during training.
